    Spawns ``cmd`` inside its own process group via ``start_new_session`` where
    available. On Windows, the child enters a kill-on-close job before it runs,
    so cleanup reaches descendants that inherit the job after launchers exit.
    Closing the job on normal return also stops detached descendants. Job setup
    failure aborts the suspended child. POSIX signals the group with SIGTERM,
    then escalates to SIGKILL if needed.

    Args:
        cmd: Command and arguments to spawn.
        timeout: Timeout in seconds passed to ``communicate()``.
        env: Optional environment dict. If None, inherits parent env.
        on_pid: Optional callable invoked with the child PID right after
            spawn. Exceptions raised by the callback are suppressed. The
            child is registered for cleanup_children() regardless.
        input_text: Optional UTF-8 text supplied on stdin, never argv.
        deadline_monotonic: Absolute operation deadline, including startup.
        cancel: Optional event checked while waiting for the command.
        cleanup_grace: Maximum TERM wait and subsequent KILL/reap wait, each.
        capture_limit_bytes: Capture to temporary files instead of pipes,
            reading at most this many bytes from each stream after exit.

    Returns:
